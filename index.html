      <p>So, I'm <b>Ikbar Faiz</b>, a Computer Science student at <b>BINUS University (3rd Semester btw)</b>.</p>
      <p>
        I’m currently interested in becoming a <b>Cloud Engineer</b> — exploring things like Azure, infrastructure,
        and automation. (I hope it turns out well bruh🥀)
      </p>
      <p>
        I also build random tools (nobody asked) for, but somehow make my life easi(hard)er.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some people use fancy CSS grids and animations to tell their story.<br>
        I use plain HTML. Because truth doesn’t need gradients (just excuse, i am naturally not build for frontend).

        That’s it. There’s nothing more.<br>
        What did you expect from a website that doesn’t even have RGB colors?
