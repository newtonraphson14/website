### 🧑‍💻 About This Website
Disclaimer for recruiters: sorry for bad design 😔

So, I'm **Ikbar Faiz**, a Computer Science student at **BINUS University (3rd Semester btw)**.

I’m currently interested in becoming a **Cloud Engineer** — exploring things like **Azure**, **infrastructure**, and **automation**.  
(I hope it turns out well bruh 🥀)

I also build random tools (nobody asked) that somehow make my life easi(hard)er.

Some people use fancy CSS grids and animations to tell their story.  
I use **plain HTML**. Because truth doesn’t need gradients.  
(*Just an excuse, I’m naturally not built for front-end.*)

That’s it. There’s nothing more.  
What did you expect from a website that doesn’t even have RGB colors?

- Might add a line of CSS (if my dignity allows)
- Integrate with Azure just because I can
- Maybe write a small script to make the page load *slightly* slower (for dramatic effect)
